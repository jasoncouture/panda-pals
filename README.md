# Goals

Develop a scalable ACID compliant RDBMS (Relational database management system)
MVP will contain:
- SELECT, INSERT, UPDATE and WHERE
- Pre-parsed binary command wire format
- Basic, manually configured clustering
- No ACID Compliance.
- No durable storage.
- Nodes will auto shard the data, and redistribute as necessary to achieve redundancy goals without exceeding, while being as even as possible.


Project planning will be done on github in further detail.
